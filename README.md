# Flow Programming Language

Flow is a simple, fast, and easy-to-learn programming language that compiles to efficient machine code using LLVM. It's designed to be intuitive for beginners while powerful enough for complex applications.

## Features

- **Simple Syntax**: Clean, C-like syntax that's easy to read and write
- **Fast Execution**: Compiles to optimized machine code via LLVM
- **Rich Standard Library**: Built-in functions for strings, math, lists, file I/O, and more
- **Performance Tools**: Built-in profiler and JIT caching for optimization
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Advanced Features**: Match statements, walrus operator, and more

## Performance

Flow offers significant performance improvements over Python:
- ~30% faster than previous versions (0.186s â†’ 0.136s on Fibonacci benchmark)
- ~20x faster than Python for compute-intensive tasks
- Approaching C-like performance for many operations

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Hello World
Create a file called `hello.flow`:
```flow
print "Hello, World!"
```

Run it:
```bash
python -m flow.flow_cli hello.flow
```

## Key Language Features

### Variables
```flow
let name = "Flow"
let age = 5
let pi = 3.14159
```

### Control Flow
```flow
if age >= 18 {
    print "You are an adult"
} else {
    print "You are a minor"
}

let i = 0
while i < 5 {
    print "Count:", i
    i = i + 1
}

# For loops (new feature)
for item in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] {
    print "Item:", item
}

# Range-based for loops (new feature)
for i in range(5) {
    print "Index:", i
}

# Match statements (new feature)
let value = 2
match value {
    case 1:
        print "One"
    case 2:
        print "Two"
    default:
        print "Other"
}
```

### Functions
```flow
func greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"
}

let message = greet("Flow")
print message
```

### Lists
```flow
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
let first = fruits[0]
fruits[0] = "orange"
append(fruits, "grape")
```

### Built-in Functions
```flow
let length = len("Hello")        # 5
let root = sqrt(16)              # 4.0
let numbers = range(5)           # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
let words = split("a,b,c", ",")  # ["a", "b", "c"]

# New built-in functions
let floored = floor(3.7)         # 3
let ceiled = ceil(3.2)           # 4
let rounded = round(3.14159, 2)  # 3.14
let randomNum = random()         # Random float 0.0-1.0
```

### Bitwise Operations (new feature)
```flow
let a = 5  # Binary: 101
let b = 3  # Binary: 011
let andResult = a & b  # 1 (Binary: 001)
let orResult = a | b   # 7 (Binary: 111)
let xorResult = a ^ b  # 6 (Binary: 110)
```

### Walrus Operator (new feature)
```flow
# Assignment within expressions
if (x := 5) > 3 {
    print "x is", x, "which is greater than 3"
}

# Using walrus operator in a while loop
let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let i = 0
while (value := data[i]) < 4 {
    print "Value is", value
    i = i + 1
}
```

## Performance Features

### Profiling
Analyze your program's performance:
```bash
python -m flow.flow_cli program.flow --profile
```

### JIT Caching
Flow automatically caches compiled functions for faster startup.
