# Walrus Operator Example
print "Walrus Operator Demo"

# Simple assignment expression
if (x := 5) > 3 {
    print "x is", x, "which is greater than 3"
}

# Using walrus operator in a while loop
let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let i = 0
while (value := data[i]) < 4 {
    print "Value is", value
    i = i + 1
}

# Walrus operator with built-in functions
let text = "Hello, Flow!"
if (length := len(text)) > 10 {
    print "Text has", length, "characters, which is more than 10"
}

# Multiple assignment expressions
let a = 10
let b = 20
if (sum := a + b) > 25 and (diff := a - b) < 5 {
    print "Sum is", sum, "and difference is", diff
}
