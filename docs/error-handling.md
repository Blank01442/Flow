# Error Handling

Flow is currently working on implementing error handling features. In the current version, invalid operations will cause the program to terminate with an error message.

In future versions, Flow will provide a try/catch mechanism to manage errors and prevent your programs from crashing when issues occur.

## Planned Try/Catch Blocks

Flow plans to use try/catch blocks to handle errors:

```flow
try {
    # Code that might cause an error
} catch error {
    # Code to handle the error
}
```

### Basic Error Handling

```flow
try {
    let result = 10 / 0
    print "Result:", result
} catch error {
    print "An error occurred:", error
}
```

### Handling Specific Errors

You can check the type or content of the error to handle different errors differently:

```flow
try {
    let content = read_file("nonexistent.txt")
    print content
} catch error {
    if error contains "not found" {
        print "File not found - using default content"
        let content = "Default content"
        print content
    } else {
        print "An unexpected error occurred:", error
    }
}
```

## Common Error Types

Flow can encounter several types of errors:

### 1. Division by Zero

Flow will terminate with an error message when attempting division by zero.

### 2. File Not Found

Flow will terminate with an error message when attempting to read a non-existent file.

### 3. Invalid List Index

Flow will terminate with an error message when accessing an invalid list index.

### 4. Type Errors

Flow will terminate with an error message when operations are performed on incompatible types.

## Error Handling Best Practices

Since Flow doesn't yet have error handling, the best practices focus on preventing errors:

### 1. Validate Inputs

Check inputs before performing operations:

```flow
func safeDivide(a, b) {
    if b == 0 {
        print "Error: Division by zero"
        return null
    }
    return a / b
}
```

### 2. Check List Bounds

Verify list indices before accessing elements:

```flow
func safeGet(list, index) {
    if index < 0 or index >= len(list) {
        print "Error: Index out of bounds"
        return null
    }
    return list[index]
}
```

### 3. Validate File Operations

Check if files exist before reading them:

```flow
# This requires a future file_exists function
# if file_exists("data.txt") {
#     let content = read_file("data.txt")
# } else {
#     print "File not found"
# }
```
