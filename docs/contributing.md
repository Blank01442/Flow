To contribute code:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Write tests if applicable
5. Ensure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

To set up Flow for development:

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Flow.git
   cd Flow
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

Flow follows these coding conventions:

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### Flow Code
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the style used in existing examples

## Testing

Flow uses a testing framework to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Running Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Writing Tests
When adding new features, include tests:
1. Create test files in the `tests/` directory
2. Follow the existing test structure
3. Test both normal and error cases
4. Ensure tests are clear and descriptive

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue the pull request

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or bug fix
- Write a clear, descriptive title
- Include a detailed description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure all tests pass

## Documentation

When contributing code, also update relevant documentation:
- Update README.md if needed
- Add or modify documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Update examples if functionality changes
- Ensure documentation is clear and accurate

## Community Guidelines

### Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Provide constructive feedback
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
